# Why API Catalog

## Background

API Catalog was launched in Nov 2022 to make API discoverability easier and to give API consumers an easy way to interact with APIs. But later, we saw a new potential in the API Catalog.

We call it **API Catalog Next**.

Every team has there own best practices in API. Some document it, and some end up in a discussion.

But how can we validate and make sure your API quality is maintained?

Consider a new developer or even a new team. How to ensure that they will follow the practices, thus the end API consumers are happy.

## Our Aim

API Catalog aims to give teams and API consumers a **quality of assurance**. It tries to answer a simple question. How good is your API? Think of it like Google Lighthouse but for your APIs.

It mainly measures three properties that define API quality.

1. Security
2. Performance
3. Quality/Best Practices

Best practices always vary around the team. But we have provided you with a very extensible and customizable system so that teams can customize it as they wish.

Catalog generates scores and reports and provides you with valuable insights like

1. Recent Activity
2. Score Metrics
3. The number of breaking changes. Give you an idea of how stable an API is.
4. Number of checks
5. And more.

But this doesn't waver us away from our initial goal. That is making the life of API consumers easier. We will make it even better. The new catalog will soon support

1. API Changelogs
2. Single source of truth for all API documents
3. Code snippets
4. Status Checks

API Catalog Next is in the **alpha state**. But hold on to your seatbelts because we are moving at light speed.
